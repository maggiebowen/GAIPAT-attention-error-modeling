# GAIPAT-attention-error-modeling
A practice project using the GAIPAT dataset

The goal of this project is to take eye-tracking data from the GAIPAT dataset to develop clusters of 'distracted' states. I chose to bin in 3 clusters as inattention happens on a continuum. Using the pupil and gazepoint files for each participant, I was able to make a few classifiers to predict states.
