# GAIPAT-attention-error-modeling
A practice project using the GAIPAT dataset

The goal of this project is two-fold: 1) predict distraction states based on gaze entropy and 2) predict error rate based on fixation time on instruction AOIs during a basic LEGO assembly task. This is a supervised approach. Given that inattention (aka distraction) exists on a continuum, I will bin gaze entropy into 3+ categories rather than classify it in a binary way. However, error rate will be treated as binary.
